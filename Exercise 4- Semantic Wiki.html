          <h1 id="abstract">PIANO</h1>
          <hr sizes="3"; color="black"></hr>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">The piano is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard. 
            Widely used in classical and jazz music for solo performances, ensemble use, chamber music and accompaniment, 
            the piano is also popular as a tool for composing and rehearsal. Although not portable and often expensive, the piano's 
            versatility and ubiquity have made it one of the world's most familiar musical instruments. Pressing a key on the piano's 
            keyboard causes a padded hammer to strike steel strings. The hammers rebound, and the strings continue to vibrate at their 
            resonant frequency. These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a sounding board that more efficiently couples the 
            acoustic energy to the air. The sound would otherwise be no louder than that directly produced by the strings. When the key is 
            released, a damper stops the string's vibration and the sound. See the article on Piano key frequencies for a picture of the piano 
            keyboard and the location of middle-C. In the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification, pianos are considered chordophones. 
            The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte, the Italian word for the instrument. The musical terms piano and forte mean "quiet" 
            and "loud", respectively, and in this context refer to variations in loudness the instrument produces in response to a pianist's touch 
            on the keys: the greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the string, and the louder the note 
            produced. The word forte in Italian actually means force or strong.</p>

          <h1 id="abstract">History</h1>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) of Italy. Cristofori was unsatisfied by 
            the lack of control that musicians had over the volume level of the harpsichord. He is credited for switching out the plucking
             mechanism with a hammer to create the modern piano in around the year 1700.
            A piano is an acoustic stringed instrument which produces sound when the strings 
            get struck by hammers. The player activates the hammers by pressings keys on a keyboard. 
            The harder the pressure, the louder the sound. But, it wasn’t always like that. 
            The history of the piano dates back to the Middle Ages when the first string instruments, hammered dulcimers, started to be played 
            in Europe. However, people wanted something different: a string instrument with a keyboard. There were a lot of attempts to achieve 
            this, and as a result, the clavichord – with strings struck by tangents – and the harpsichord – with strings plucked by raven quills 
            – were developed and became very popular. Even though all of the innovations were impressive, it still wasn’t enough. The harpsichord 
            didn’t have the control over the dynamics – how loud or soft the performer could play.  And the clavichord sounded too delicate and 
            would often be overpowered by the sound of other instruments.</p>

            <h1 id="abstract">Types of Piano</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">There are two main types of piano: the grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano has a 
                better sound and gives the player a more precise control of the keys, and is therefore the preferred choice for every situation 
                in which the available floor-space and the budget will allow, as well as often being considered a requirement in venues where 
                skilled pianists will frequently give public performances. The upright piano, which necessarily involves some compromise in both 
                tone and key action compared to a grand piano of equivalent quality, is nevertheless much more widely used, because it occupies 
                less space (allowing it to fit comfortably in a room where a grand piano would be too large) and is significantly less expensive.
                <br><br>Here are the <b>2</b> main types of a Piano:</p>
